Step 2: The system will generate a Qr code after successful registration. For security, the user needs to back up the QR Code by saving it to the mobile phone album, and enter the wallet home page after the backup is successful.\n\nCase 2 - Existing account, login with the Account QR Code: Step 1: Click 'login' to enter the login page. Step 2: Scan the QR Code and enter the password. After login successfully, enter the wallet home page.",
      "qRCode": "What is the Account QR Code?",
      "qRCodeE": "The Account QR Code is actually a keystore. Users can decrypt the keystore to get the private key for subsequent signature.\n\nCommon blockchain accounts require users to understand lots of professional terms, such as public and private keys, addresses, mnemonics and even keystore, which brings users a lot of learning costs and use costs. In the aelf account system, we use a QR code to represent the account. Users only need to generate the corresponding QR code.  Users can complete the subsequent login or other operations by saving the QR code and the corresponding password.",
      "backupQRCode": "Why do I have to back up the Account QR Code?",
      "backupQRCodeE": "Because the Account QR Code is actually a keystore, keystore file is a file format (JSON) for storing private key of blockchain wallet. It requires a user-defined password and store the password in the file to get good protection. Users need to use the Account QR Code to log in to their account. Losing the QR code is the same as losing the account assets, and once lost, it cannot be recovered. Therefore, it is necessary to back up your Account QR Code to avoid losing the account.",
      "forgetPwd": "What if you forget your account password?",
      "forgetPwdE": "The Password of Account QR Code is unique, can not be changed, so be sure to remember the account password. Forgetting the password is equivalent to losing the account assets, and the APP does not support getting back the password.",
      "receiveTransfer": "How to receive and transfer money?",
      "receiveTransferE": "You can choose Receive Money or Transfer Money in 'My' page, and click 'Transfer' or 'Receive' to get started it.\n\nTransfer: The receiving address can be entered either by scanning the code (the QR Code can be selected from the album) or by filling it in manually.\n\nReceive: You can receive money by showing the QR code face to face, sharing the QR code with the other people, or copying the receiving address to the other people to collect money.",
      "crossTransfer": "How to make cross chain transfer?",
      "crossTransferE": "If a cross-Chain transfer is required, the receiver's address needs to change to a designated Chain ID.\n\nFor example, when Tokens are transferred to the tDVV chain address where the ELF_address_AELF is known, it is necessary to change the address to ELF_address_tDVV and then complete the tokens transfer according to the hints.\n\nNote:\n\nThe Cross-Chain Transfer requires two transactions, one is to send transaction, the other is to confirm transaction.  There is a certain block confirmation time between them. You can check cross-chain transfers need to be confirmed in 'Transaction Management-Unconfirmed cross-chain transactions'.\n\nMake sure you have enough tokens to cover the costs in both chains.",
      "howBiometrics": "How do you use biometrics to trade?",
